# Installing DSL Dependencies
The DeepStream Services Library (DSL) is built on the NVIDA® [DeepStream SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk) and requires all SDK components to be installed and verified. The current Alpha version of DSL supports only the NVIDI® Jetson™ platform, and all development and testing to date has been purposely done on the Jetson Nano™, the smallest model with the most constraints on resources. Testing will be scalled up to the bigger models before releasing v1.0.

Please consult the [NVIDIA DeepStream Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/index.html) for complete Installation Instructions.
