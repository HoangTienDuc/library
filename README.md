DSL is best described as _"the NVIDIA DeepStream Reference Application, [deepstream-app](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/index.html#page/DeepStream_Development_Guide%2Fdeepstream_app_architecture.html), re-imagined (and redeveloped) as a static library of ondemand DeepStream pipeline services"._

Written in C++ 11, DSL is built on the NVIDAÂ® [DeepStream SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk), _"A complete streaming analytics toolkit for AI-based video and image understanding, as well as multi-sensor processing."_, 

The DeepStream SDK and DSL use the open source [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/),  _"An extremely powerful and versatile framework for creating streaming media applications"_.
