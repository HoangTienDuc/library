# deepstream-services-library (DSL)

![](/Images/under-construction.png)

DSL is described as _"the NVIDIA DeepStream sample application, `deepstream-app`, redeveloped as a static library - implementing an API for DeepStream pipeline services"._

Written in C++ 11, DSL is built on the NVIDAÂ® [DeepStream SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk), _"A complete streaming analytics toolkit for AI-based video and image understanding, as well as multi-sensor processing."_, 

The DeepStream SDK and DSL use the open source [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/),  _"An extremely powerful and versatile framework for creating streaming media applications"_.
