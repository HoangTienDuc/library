# deepstream-services-library (DSL)

![](/Images/under-construction.png)

DSL is best described as _"all the functionality of the NVIDIA DeepStream Reference Application - [deepstream-app](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/index.html#page/DeepStream_Development_Guide%2Fdeepstream_app_architecture.html) - re-imagined as a shared library of on-demand DeepStream pipeline services"._

Written in C++ 11, the DSL API can be  called from both C/C++ and Python applications.

**C/C++**
```C++
#include <DslApi.h>

dsl_pipeline_new("myPipeline");
```
**Python**
```Python
import ctypes
libc = ctypes.CDLL("dsl-lib.so")

libc.dsl_pipeline_new("myPipeline")
```

DSL is built on the NVIDAÂ® [DeepStream SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk), _"A complete streaming analytics toolkit for AI-based video and image understanding, as well as multi-sensor processing."_, 

The DeepStream SDK and DSL use the open source [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/),  _"An extremely powerful and versatile framework for creating streaming media applications"_.
